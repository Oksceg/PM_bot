96	Palpatine	It is only natural.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/nat.png
97	Obi-Wan	Wait a minute, how did this happen? We're smarter than this.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/smarter.png
98	General Grievous	Ah, yes. The negotiator.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/neg.png

112	Mace Windu	You are on this Council. But we do not grant you the rank of Master.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/rank2.png

116	Ki-Adi-Mundi	What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/wookiees.png
117	Obi-Wan	It's a system we cannot afford to lose. 	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/system.png
118	Mace Windu	 It is critical we send an attack group there immediately.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/crit.png
119	Mace Windu	It's settled then.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/settled.png
120	Obi-Wan	This assignment is not to be on record.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/rec.png
121	Anakin	You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. 	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/j code.png
122	Palpatine	Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise?	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/tragedy.png
123	Palpatine	It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. 	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/story.png
124	Palpatine	The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/pathway.png
125	Palpatine	Ironic.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/ironic.png
126	Palpatine	Ironic, he could save others from death, but not himself.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/ironic2.png
127	Anakin	Is it possible to learn this power?	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/learn power.png
128	Palpatine	Not from a jedi.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/not.png
129	Anakin	I've just been so frustrated with the Council.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/frust.png
130	Obi-Wan	You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. 	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/proud.png
131	Obi-Wan	Goodbye, old friend. May the Force be with you.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/goodbye.png

142	General Grievous	you must realize you are doomed.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/think2.png
143	Obi-Wan	Oh, I don't think so.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/think2.png
144	Palpatine	Use my knowledge, I beg you.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/beg.png
145	Palpatine	Are you going to kill me?	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/kill me.png
146	Anakin	I would certainly like to.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/kill me.png
147	Obi-Wan	So uncivilized.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/unciv.png
148	Anakin	I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/SL.png
149	Mace Windu	Then our worst fears have been realized.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/fears.png
150	Mace Windu	 If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/gain.png
151	Palpatine	 I must say, you're here sooner than expected.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/here sooner.png
152	Mace Windu	In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/under arrest.png
153	Palpatine	Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/threaten.png
154	Mace Windu	The Senate will decide your fate.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/sen dec.png
155	Palpatine	I am the Senate!	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/amsen.png
156	Mace Windu	Not. Yet.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/notyet.png
157	Palpatine	It's treason then.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/treason.png
158	Palpatine	The Jedi are taking over.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/take over.png
159	Palpatine	No.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/no_p.png
160	Palpatine	You must choose!	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/choose.png
161	Mace Windu	He is too dangerous to be left alive.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/left al.png
162	Mace Windu	He is too dangerous to be kept alive.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/kept al.png
163	Palpatine	I am too weak.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/weak.png
164	Anakin	It's not the Jedi way!	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/not j way.png
165	Anakin	I need him!	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/need.png
166	Palpatine	Unlimited power!	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/unlim.png
167	Anakin	What have I done?	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/done.png
168	Palpatine	Good.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/good_p.png
169	Darth Sidious	Execute order 66.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/66.png
170	Youngling	Master Skywalker, there are too many of them. What are we going to do?	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/many.png
171	Youngling	Master Skywalker, there are too many of them. What are we going to do?	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/many2.png
172	Obi-Wan	Who? Who could have done this?	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/who.png
173	Palpatine	The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/attempt.png
174	Palpatine	In order to ensure the security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/emp.png
175	Padme	So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/liberty.png
176	Obi-Wan	I can't watch any more.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/watch.png

179	Obi-Wan	I'm so sorry.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/sosorry.png
180	Padme	Obi-Wan told me terrible things. He said you have turned to the dark side...that you killed younglings.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/ter things.png
181	Anakin	Because of Obi-Wan?	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/because.png
182	Anakin	Liar!	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/liar.png

184	Anakin	You turned her against me!	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/turned.png
185	Obi-Wan	You have done that yourself.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/yourself.png
186	Anakin	You will not take her from me!	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/from me.png
187	Obi-Wan	Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/lust.png
188	Obi-Wan	You have become the very thing you swore to destroy.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/become.png
189	Anakin	Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/lecture.png
190	Anakin	I see through the lies of the Jedi.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/lies.png

195	Obi-Wan	Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic, to democracy!	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/democracy.png
196	Anakin	If you're not with me, you're my enemy.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/enemy.png
197	Obi-Wan	Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/abs.png
