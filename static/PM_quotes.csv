93	Palpatine	Kill him. Kill him now.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/kill now.png
94	Anakin	 I shouldn't have done that. It's not the Jedi way.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/j way.png
95	Palpatine	It is only natural.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/nat.png
96	Obi-Wan	Wait a minute, how did this happen? We're smarter than this.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/smarter.png
97	General Grievous	Ah, yes. The negotiator.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/neg.png

108	Padme	Something wonderful has happened.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/sth wndf.png
109	Anakin	That's . . . that's wonderful.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/wndf.png
110	Mace Windu	You are on this Council. But we do not grant you the rank of Master.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/rank.png
111	Mace Windu	You are on this Council. But we do not grant you the rank of Master.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/rank2.png
112	Anakin	This is outrageous, it's unfair.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/unfair.png
113	Anakin	How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/how.png
114	Mace Windu	Take a seat, young Skywalker.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/seat.png
115	Ki-Adi-Mundi	What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/wookiees.png
116	Obi-Wan	It's a system we cannot afford to lose. 	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/system.png
117	Mace Windu	 It is critical we send an attack group there immediately.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/crit.png
118	Mace Windu	It's settled then.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/settled.png
119	Obi-Wan	This assignment is not to be on record.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/rec.png
120	Anakin	You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. 	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/j code.png
121	Palpatine	Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise?	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/tragedy.png
122	Palpatine	It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. 	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/story.png
123	Palpatine	The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/pathway.png
124	Palpatine	Ironic.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/ironic.png
125	Palpatine	Ironic, he could save others from death, but not himself.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/ironic2.png
126	Anakin	Is it possible to learn this power?	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/learn power.png
127	Palpatine	Not from a jedi.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/not.png
128	Anakin	I've just been so frustrated with the Council.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/frust.png
129	Obi-Wan	You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. 	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/proud.png
130	Obi-Wan	Goodbye, old friend. May the Force be with you.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/goodbye.png

138	Obi-Wan	Your move.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/your move.png
139	General Grievous	you must realize you are doomed.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/doomed.png
140	Obi-Wan	Oh, I don't think so.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/think.png
141	General Grievous	you must realize you are doomed.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/think2.png
142	Obi-Wan	Oh, I don't think so.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/think2.png
143	Palpatine	Use my knowledge, I beg you.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/beg.png
144	Palpatine	Are you going to kill me?	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/kill me.png
145	Anakin	I would certainly like to.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/kill me.png
146	Obi-Wan	So uncivilized.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/unciv.png
147	Anakin	I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/SL.png
148	Mace Windu	Then our worst fears have been realized.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/fears.png
149	Mace Windu	 If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/gain.png
150	Palpatine	 I must say, you're here sooner than expected.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/here sooner.png
151	Mace Windu	In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/under arrest.png
152	Palpatine	Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/threaten.png
153	Mace Windu	The Senate will decide your fate.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/sen dec.png
154	Palpatine	I am the Senate!	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/amsen.png
155	Mace Windu	Not. Yet.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/notyet.png
156	Palpatine	It's treason then.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/treason.png
157	Palpatine	The Jedi are taking over.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/take over.png
158	Palpatine	No.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/no_p.png
159	Palpatine	You must choose!	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/choose.png
160	Mace Windu	He is too dangerous to be left alive.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/left al.png
161	Mace Windu	He is too dangerous to be kept alive.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/kept al.png
162	Palpatine	I am too weak.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/weak.png
163	Anakin	It's not the Jedi way!	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/not j way.png
164	Anakin	I need him!	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/need.png
165	Palpatine	Unlimited power!	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/unlim.png
166	Anakin	What have I done?	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/done.png
167	Palpatine	Good.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/good_p.png
168	Darth Sidious	Execute order 66.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/66.png
169	Youngling	Master Skywalker, there are too many of them. What are we going to do?	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/many.png
170	Youngling	Master Skywalker, there are too many of them. What are we going to do?	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/many2.png
171	Obi-Wan	Who? Who could have done this?	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/who.png
172	Palpatine	The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/attempt.png
173	Palpatine	In order to ensure the security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/emp.png
174	Padme	So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/liberty.png
175	Obi-Wan	I can't watch any more.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/watch.png
176	Obi-Wan	I have seen a security hologram of him... killing younglings. [starts beatboxing]	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/beatbox.png
177	Obi-Wan	Anakin is the father, isn't he?	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/father.png
178	Obi-Wan	I'm so sorry.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/sosorry.png
179	Padme	Obi-Wan told me terrible things. He said you have turned to the dark side...that you killed younglings.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/ter things.png
180	Anakin	Because of Obi-Wan?	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/because.png
181	Anakin	Liar!	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/liar.png
182	Anakin	You brought him here to kill me!	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/brought.png
183	Anakin	You turned her against me!	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/turned.png
184	Obi-Wan	You have done that yourself.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/yourself.png
185	Anakin	You will not take her from me!	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/from me.png
186	Obi-Wan	Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/lust.png
187	Obi-Wan	You have become the very thing you swore to destroy.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/become.png
188	Anakin	Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/lecture.png
189	Anakin	I see through the lies of the Jedi.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/lies.png
190	Anakin	I have brought peace, justice, freedom, and security to my new Empire.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/peace.png

193	Anakin	Don't make me kill you.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/kill u.png
194	Obi-Wan	Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic, to democracy!	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/democracy.png
195	Anakin	If you're not with me, you're my enemy.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/enemy.png
196	Obi-Wan	Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/abs.png
197	Obi-Wan	I will do what I must.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/must.png
198	Anakin	You will try.	/home/oks110/PM_bot/static/3/try.png
